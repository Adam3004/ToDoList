 **Authors: Aleksandra Smela and Adam Misztal**.


## Set your goals and track your progress
First part of the app is "to do" list, where you can add as many tasks as you want. When you complete any task you receive 5 stars. Collect them - you can use them in the game part of the app. All completed tasks are stored in history and you have easy access to see what you have already done.


## Have a break and discover new pics
Everyone needs a break. Here you can use your break to play the 2048 game within the same app. And when you are bored with the default color theme you can change it for something cool - of course only if you have enough stars to do it. That is another motivation to fulfill your tasks. \

What if you forget yourself playing? No worries, if you have any undone task past the dealine the game is blocked till you complete it. 


## Save your progress
You don't need to remember to save your progress. All your tasks and game score is saved automatically when you close the app. Next time you just need to sign in with your login and password and you have everything as you left it.

### Enjoy!
